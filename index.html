    <h1>All of my hobbies!</h1>
    <p>I really like to play football. I play Goalkeeper but I also like to play defender.</p>
 <p>I also like to read lots of books. I have a whole bookshelf! </p>
<p>I play online games every now and then on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
<p> I LOVE to play tag since I like running around which is what me and my friends used to play in the school I was in before St-Christophers</p>
<p> I enjoy playing dodgeball too. </p>
